Git is a useful tool that computer science majors use to share their code and also edit code and collaborate with other colleagues on software. A command to use to initialize a git repository is git init. The command touch adds a new file to the repository. The command git status checks for what files git recognizes in your repository. The command git add <filename> adds a file to a commit, and then the command git commit packaged the files to a commit. More importantly, to create a commit, the command git commit -m "Your message" is used. To push our created repository, we simply use the git remote add origin <link from GitHub> followed by the git push -u origin master.
